## Choose your own adventure

The purpose of creating this repository was to be able to use what we have been learning the past couple of weeks which is how to collaborate and solve merge conflicts if you accidently get into one. We also used our knowledge on linking files to create this project because without that then we wouldn't have been able to make this project.
