## Choose your own adventure

The purpose of creating this repository was to be able to use what we have been learning the past couple of weeks which is how to collaborate and link files.  Collaboration is a very useful tool and knowing the right steps to fix a problem like merge conflicts can get you far. As we developed our project we ran into merge conflicts, but thankfully since we learned how to resolve merge conflicts, we were able to get out of any conflict or problem we had. We also used our knowledge on linking files, relatives file paths, and absolute file paths to create this project because without it, we wouldn't have been able to make this project.
